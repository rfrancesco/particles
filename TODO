# Urgent TODOs for cleaning up the code

- Graphics: Separate concerns for simulation window and utils (ImGui) window
    -> Possibly abstract away the plotting?

- Physics: 
    - "World" particle registry
    - Configurable Collision detection algorithms (e.g. by composition of an AbstractCollisionEngine::Naive/SpatialHashing/QuadTree)
    - Physics engine should be separate from the rest of the code, and have its own namespace
    - Get rid of static variables!

- Vector2:
    - It's ridiculous to have a Vector class without overloading!
